VARIABLES
---------

The data contains the mean of 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocities
at a constant rate of 50Hz as derived from a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone worn on the hip
during different activities by 30 volunteers.

SUMMARY CHOICES
---------------

The data excluded everything but the mean or standard deviation columns which resulted
in the following (66) row.names:

* "activity_id"                          
* "activity_name"

This was further broken down by subject (of which there were 30) and
activity (6) which consisted of:

* WALKING
* WALKING UPSTAIRS
* WALKING DOWNSTAIRS
* SITTING
* STANDING
* LAYING

Resulting in a total of 180 (30*6) columns.
30 Volunteers with 6 activities each.
